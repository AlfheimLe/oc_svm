# Temporal segmentation using one-class support vector machines

This Matlab project is used as an experimental setup for the master thesis of Roemer Vlasveld.

## What libraries are used?
For the one-class support vector machine, the SVDD method by Tax and Duin is used.
This is provided by the [dd_tools](http://prlab.tudelft.nl/david-tax/dd_tools.html) package, which in turn relies on the [PRTools](http://prtools.org/software/) toolbox.
